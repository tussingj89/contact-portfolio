# easy-to-read grids

Below is a sample of the code using HTML grid layout. As you can see the code is layed out in a way that makes its location on the screen easy to understand.


              <div class="col-sm-12">
                  <h1>Contacts</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <h3>Name:</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="card col-lg-12">
                <h4 class="card-text">Name:</h4>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <h3>Email:</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="card col-lg-12">
                <h4 class="card-text">Email:</h4>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
